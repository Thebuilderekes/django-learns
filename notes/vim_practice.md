This is where i am going to be trying out vim motions. I will be updating the text here as i go along and all  use this as a way to improve my typing speed(hopefully). I can use ysiw " to wrap a word in quotation mark and also ysiw [] to wrap int in brackets.


I will be using the block of text to practice visual block mode edits.
